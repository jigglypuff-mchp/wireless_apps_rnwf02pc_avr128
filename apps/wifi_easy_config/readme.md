# Wi-Fi Easy Configuration

This RNWF02 application illustrates the use of Wi-Fi Soft-AP mode for Wi-Fi provisioning via HTTP.

## Description

This RNWF02 application demonstrates how a user can configure the device with the credentials of the Home-AP. The device will boot-up in Soft-AP mode, user will connect to Soft-AP via a third party STA (any laptop/mobile phone). User will then provide the Home-AP credentials to the device using HTTP webpage. Once this provisioning is successful, the device mode is set to Wi-Fi STA mode. It will then connect to the Home-AP and get an IP address.

## Hardware Requirements

- Host MCU [AVR128DB48 CURIOSITY NANO](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR128DB48) with Curiosity Nano Base for Click Boards

## Running the Application

1. Mount AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano and RNWF02 Add-on Boards over Curiosity Nano base for click boards at respective headers as shown below.
![setup_hardware_for_demo](../../assets/hw_setup.png)

2. Connect the debugger USB port on the AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano board to computer using a micro USB cable

3. Open the project and launch MCC with Melody Content Manager Tool

4. RNWF02 Wi-Fi Soft-AP mode credentials can be found at [main.c](../wifi_easy_config/rnwf02_wifi_easy_config.X/main.c#L47)

5. Build and program the code into the hardware using IDE

6. Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term or PuTTY\) on the computer

7. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None

8. The board will boot-up in Wi-Fi Soft-AP mode, as per the configurations given in step 4. Connect to the Soft-AP via a third party STA (any laptop/mobile phone). Soft-AP mode SSID and IP address will be available on the serial console as shown below:

![rnwf02_softap_ip](../../assets/wifi_provisioning_softap_0.png)

![rnwf02_softap_ssid_broadcast](../../assets/wifi_provisioning_console_output_1.png)

9. Open the browser and enter the Soft-AP mode IP address(example: http://192.168.1.1/). 

![rnwf02_softap_http_page_scan](../../assets/wifi_provision_scan.png)

10. Click on "scan", which will start a scan for new AP list. From the drop-down available, select the target Home-AP name fill-in the "Password" field for the selected Home-AP and click on "Provision".

![rnwf02_softap_http_page_wifi_provision](../../assets/wifi_provision.png)

11. Once the Wi-Fi provisioning is completed successfully, below message will appear on the HTTP webpage

![rnwf02_softap_http_page_provision_success](../../assets/provision_success.png)

12. The board will now connect to the Home-AP and get an IP address. The IP address is displayed on the serial console as shown:
